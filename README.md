# malconv

ember-malconv is the code from embers github page. I only change the way it takes the input such that we can work with Microsoft dataset

malconv-pytorch is a code pytorch code that i found online which is a bit different such that it uses Adam optimizer instead of SGD

kerem-pytorch is a code such that i took the model and dataset code from malconv-pytorch but i restructure the code such that it is easy to change and maintain and find errors
